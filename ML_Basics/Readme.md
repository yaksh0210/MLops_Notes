+ Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 

+ ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across.

+ As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn.

## Types of Machine Learning

+ There are several types of machine learning, each with special characteristics and applications. 

+ Some of the main types of machine learning algorithms are as follows:

1. Supervised Machine Learning
2. Unsupervised Machine Learning
3. Semi-Supervised Machine Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning

## 1. Supervised Machine Learning

+ Supervised learning is defined as when a model gets trained on a “Labelled Dataset”. 
+ Labelled datasets have both input and output parameters. 
+ In Supervised Learning algorithms learn to map points between inputs and correct outputs. 
+ It has both training and validation datasets labelled.

+ There are two main categories of supervised learning that are mentioned below:

1. Classification
2. Regression

**1. Classification :** 

+ Deals with predicting categorical target variables, which represent discrete classes or labels. For instance, classifying emails as spam or not spam.

**2. Regression:**

+ Deals with predicting continuous target variables, which represent numerical values. For example, predicting the price of a house based on its size, location, and amenities


### Advantages of Supervised Machine Learning

+ Supervised Learning models can have high accuracy as they are trained on labelled data.

+ The process of decision-making in supervised learning models is often interpretable.

+ It can often be used in pre-trained models which saves time and resources when developing new models from scratch.

### Disadvantages of Supervised Machine Learning

+ It has limitations in knowing patterns and may struggle with unseen or unexpected patterns that are not present in the training data.

+ It can be time-consuming and costly as it relies on labeled data only.

+ It may lead to poor generalizations based on new data.

### Applications of Supervised Learning

+ Speech recognition: convert speech to text

+ Predictive analytics: Predict outcomes, such as sales, customer churn, and stock prices

+ Weather forecasting: Make predictions for temperature, precipitation, and other meteorological parameters

+ Email spam detection: Classify emails as spam or not spam.

+ Recommendation systems: Make personalized recommendations to users.

## 2. Unsupervised Machine Learning

+ Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning technique in which an algorithm discovers patterns and relationships using unlabeled data. 

+ Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning doesn’t involve providing the algorithm with labeled target outputs. 

+ The primary goal of Unsupervised learning is often to discover hidden patterns, similarities, or clusters within the data, which can then be used for various purposes,   such as data exploration, visualization, dimensionality reduction, and more.
